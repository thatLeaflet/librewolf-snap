summary: A custom version of Firefox, focused on privacy, security and freedom
description: |
  This project is an independent fork of Firefox, with the primary goals of privacy security and user freedom. It is the community run successor to LibreFox.

  LibreWolf uses more than 500 privacy/security/performance settings, patches, LibreWolf-Addons (optional) and is designed to minimize data collection and telemetry as much as possible (updater, crashreporter and Firefox’s integrated addons that don’t respect privacy are removed).

  LibreWolf is NOT associated with Mozilla or its products.
  
  Note: This is an unofficial repackaging and is not endorsed by the upstream project.
